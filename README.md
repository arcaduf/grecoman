Graphical RECOnstruction MANager 1.1-beta
========

## Installation
Run the following command from x02da-cons-2 *or* on your AFS account:

```
curl -o ~/Desktop/GRecoMan https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnudo/grecoman/master/GRecoMan;chmod a+x ~/Desktop/GRecoMan;
```

For running the application, you'll find a Desktop-icon for GRecoMan that you simply need to double-click.

## Usage

Since it's still a beta version, there are a few missing warnings in the GUI when mistyping some things. Therefore note the following:

* everything starts by loading a tif directory and selecting the location from where GRecoMan is running
* note that for running a full reconstruction you must also check the sinogram-creation box
* on computers with newer OpenSSH versions (above 5.6), you cannot run the program from the terminal - just by double-clicking the Desktop-icon
